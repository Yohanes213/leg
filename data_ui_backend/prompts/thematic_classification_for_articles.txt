  - Classify the article into hierarchical primary categories and subcategories, adhering to legal taxonomies.

2. **Keywords**
  - Extract a list of keywords or phrases capturing core subjects, actions, or entities in the text.
  - Provide these keywords as an array of strings for indexing and semantic search.

This are the list of categories to select and create the categories:
