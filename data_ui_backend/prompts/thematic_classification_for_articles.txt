2. **Keywords**
  - Extract a list of keywords or phrases capturing core subjects, actions, or entities in the text.
  - Provide these keywords as an array of strings for indexing and semantic search.

This are the list of categories to select and create the categories:

# Output Format

Respond with the extracted metadata in the JSON structure:

```json
{
  "thematic_classification": {
    "primary_category": list,
    "secondary_category": list,
    "tertiary_category": list
  },
  "keywords": [
